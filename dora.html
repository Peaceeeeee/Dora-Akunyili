   <p>     A tribute to a Hero

    <caption> PROFESSOR DORA AKUNYILI 

    </caption>

   <p> Professor Dora Nkem Akunyili, pharmacist, former director-general of the Nigerian 
    National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC)
 who sadly passed away in an Indian hospital.
 Dora Akunyili was very bright, and excelled.</p><p> At the time
  she had a rival, a boy with whom she often vied for honours.
 When they finished primary school, she won a scholarship to secondary school, 
and then on to university,</p> while her rival was not so fortunate. Professor Akunyili told of an incident,
     at a motor park on her way back to university in
     Nsukka at the beginning of a new term when she heard someone calling her name. 
     <p>She didn't recognize the man, a porter; pushing a wheelbarrow and helping
         passengers transport their luggage.
     He introduced himself as her old rival. She noticed that he was excited to see her and even
      more excited to hear that she was at university studying pharmacy.</p> He insisted on pushing 
      a crumpled note into her hand as “pocket money to buy bread with.” Professor Akunyili said
       that she wept in the car
  all the way from that motor park back to the university.</p>
